# touchlang ![](https://touchlang.solsort.com/icon-small.png)

The purpose is to make a touch-oriented tool/programming environment for interacting with data, and making apps.

Ideas:

- Code as data, instead text. Primary stored as json, - and secondary mapped to/from a canonical edit-friendly text representation.
- Embrace JSON. It has shortcomings, but has a simple mental model, and is ubiquitous.
- Concrete data, - work with concrete data
- zoomable / time-travelling debugger / code exploration.
